Team Members: Alex Baraban, Catherine Wanko, Michael Nicholas, Ryan Hough  
Submission Date: October 31, 2024  
**Instructor**: Kevin  

## Project Title  
**ScriptureSeeker: An AI-Powered Bible Verse Recommendation System**

## Project Description  
This project aims to develop a supervised learning model to assign embeddings to Bible verses. The goal is to retrieve the most relevant verse in response to a query using cosine similarity. The King James version of the Bible will be used for the training data. We plan to develop a model that can efficiently provide contextually appropriate verses based on input queries.

## Project Industry  
Self-Help, Inspiration

## Data Sources  
- **Primary Data Source**: [Kaggle Bible Dataset (King James Version)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oswinrh/bible) - We will use the `t_kjv` file from this dataset.
- **Secondary Data Source**: TBD

## Key Research and Exploration Questions  
Although this is primarily a query model project using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the key challenge will be to:
- Develop a model that retrieves relevant Bible verses based on specific input topics or queries.
- Test the effectiveness of the query results using cosine similarity to determine relevance between the query and the Bible verses.
